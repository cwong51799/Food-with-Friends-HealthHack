# Food with Friends HealthHack
What started out in our Freshman ITS 102 class has now been realized as a working application! Our greatest challenge for this hackathon was working with new technologies such as Android Studio, Git, and Google Firestore. We learned how to adapt and work our way around countless syntax errors which kept appearing time and time again. We found this to be a valuable team-building experience and will definitely come back again and give it another try.

This is our Food with Friend app which encourages positive interaction between old friends and potential new ones. We believe we can make an impact on the mental health of students by giving the tools they need to meet up and eat with their friends around campus.

Food with Friends allows users to create an account and profile and then share their location with friends. Next time you're going to eat on campus, give the app a check to see if anyone else you know is doing the same!

The android application works as an interface for the Firestore database, which holds the users information.
